Library for creating card games in general.

## Packages

- `@cardsgame/examples` - all of the below packages stiched up together with React. Use it as an example of how to use both server and client side code.
- `@cardsgame/server` - base server-side lib. Just write your own game actions, condition and elemens (classic card games already included)
