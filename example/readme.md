# `@cardsgame/example`

Example usage of client/server packages of Cards Game.
As simple as possible, JS-only, fully playable, game of ["War"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)>).

You'll notice I remixed the gameplay a little so it's much quicker to win. Feel free to play around yourself.

> Note: CardsGame is still best experienced with TypeScript.

Build client-side code and start the server app:

```
npm run build
npm start
```

This will take care of creating self-signed certificates. Just open up https://localhost.
